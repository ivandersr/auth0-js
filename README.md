# Auth0 for Node.js with Express in 10 minutes
This is a simple example of how to add Auth0 to a Node.js with express project in 10 minutes (or less).

Most of the code here is boilerplate recommended from [Express openid Connect](https://github.com/auth0/express-openid-connect) lib, with some login/logout and profile routes with auth requirement middleware and automatic redirection.
